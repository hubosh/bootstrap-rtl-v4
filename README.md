# Bootstrap 4 RTL Theme

> Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.


Bootstrap RTL provides simple yet robust right-to-left capability for Bootstrap 4, by employing new theming feature of it. Simply put its CSS after bootstrap's original CSS, to the pages designed by Bootstrap 4. It works just like an extension on top of the original Bootstrap:

```html
<!-- Original Bootstrap 4 -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.css">

<!-- Bootstrap RTL V4 Theme -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap-rtl.css">
```

Or load it from CDN:

```html
<!-- Load Bootstrap RTL theme from RawGit -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.rawgit.com/sh-sh-dev/bootstrap-rtl-v4/master/dist/bootstrap-rtl.min.css">
```
